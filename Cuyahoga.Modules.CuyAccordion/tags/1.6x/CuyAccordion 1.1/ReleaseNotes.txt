A module Cuyahoga enabling the 'jquery.accordion.js' jQuery plugin http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Accordion

- Accordions Node specific: When editing Accordions only those created on the node show.
- You can now have multiple Accordions in a node. The js is added via 'RegisterClientScriptBlock()'.
- Modal fckEditor popup in AccordionItems GridView editor.

This is the original version built using a customised (but core and module compatible) trunk Cuyahoga. A version tested on Cuyahoga 1.6x is in the trunk. The module should work with 1.5 also without too much trouble, I have not tested.

This is the first release. There are still some features to be added and some  
Cleaning up/refactoring to do. 

CuyAccordion is a basic module that makes it easy to add Accordions to your Cuyahoga site.

Bugfixes:
- send bug finds to john@novocreations.com or post on the forum

This was actually built using a slightly customised (but still core and module compatible) and then briefly tested with Cuyahoga 1.6.

It is a simple little module. There are a few other bits I may add and the code has yet to be cleaned/refactored a little. But it seems to work fine.
